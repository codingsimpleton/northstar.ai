# Mixture of Agents (MoA) Red Team – Project Overview

## 1. What is Mixture of Agents (MoA)?

Mixture of Agents (MoA) is an AI-driven architecture where a complex task, such as penetration testing, is divided into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is managed by specialized agents (similar to sub-models) with expertise in specific domains. A central **Agent Coordinator** determines which agent is best suited to handle a given input or scenario. This approach provides:
- **Efficiency:** Only the required agents are activated, optimizing resource usage.
- **Scalability:** New agents can be easily integrated for emerging tasks.
- **Specialization:** Improved results due to focused expertise of each agent.

## 2. MoA-Based Red Team Project Structure

### **A. Planning Phase**
- **Defining Objectives:** Identify the security aspects to test, such as vulnerabilities in AI systems, infrastructure weaknesses, or resilience to social engineering.
- **Selecting Agents:** Assign agents to specific attack vectors or threat domains (e.g., one agent for phishing, another for API exploitation, another for prompt injection testing).
- **Agent Coordinator Design:** The Agent Coordinator evaluates the input (e.g., type of system or attack scenario) and dispatches it to the most suitable agent.

### **B. Training Phase**
- **Agent Development:** Each agent is trained on datasets relevant to its specialization (e.g., datasets for phishing, API exploits, or prompt injection).
- **Coordinator Training:** The Agent Coordinator learns to route tasks effectively based on input features and past agent performance.
- **Collaborative Training:** The entire system (agents + coordinator) undergoes joint training to enhance interoperability and maximize success rates (e.g., vulnerability detection, attack simulation accuracy).

### **C. Operational (Testing) Phase**
- **Simulating Attack Scenarios:** The MoA red team executes simulated attacks, with the Coordinator dynamically assigning agents to handle each phase (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation, escalation).
- **Automation and Analysis:** Each agent’s actions, successes, and failures are logged for evaluation.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Results are compiled into actionable reports for security teams, including recommendations for improvements.

## 3. Advantages of the MoA Approach in Red Teaming

- **Precision:** Specialized agents excel at detecting specific vulnerabilities.
- **Modularity:** Agents can be added, removed, or updated independently.
- **Resilience:** If one agent fails, others continue operating without disruption.
- **Automation:** Streamlines repetitive tasks, minimizing human error and increasing consistency.

## 4. Example MoA Red Team Architecture

| Component                | Function                                                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent 1 (Phishing)       | Simulates and analyzes social engineering attacks                      |
| Agent 2 (API Exploitation) | Detects and exploits API vulnerabilities                               |
| Agent 3 (LLM Security)   | Tests language models for prompt injection and jailbreak resilience     |
| Agent 4 (Network Scanning)| Performs network infrastructure scanning and penetration testing        |
| Agent Coordinator        | Routes tasks to the appropriate agents based on input                  |
| Reporting System         | Aggregates results and generates detailed reports                      |

## 5. Workflow

1. **Input:** Attack scenario or target system type
2. **Coordination:** The Agent Coordinator selects the most appropriate agent(s) for the task
3. **Execution:** The selected agent performs the assigned task
4. **Result Aggregation:** Results are compiled and analyzed
5. **Reporting:** Recommendations and findings are presented

## 6. Practical Notes

- Collaboration with blue teams and threat intelligence teams is essential for success.
- Tailor agents to the client’s unique environment and objectives.
- Regularly monitor and update agents to ensure effectiveness against evolving threats.
